# React Shopping Cart
A minimal shopping cart concept built with ReactJS

#### Why?

This shopping cart concept is my attempt to learn the ReactJS library. This is also an example of how data flows in React. Please check out the code for more information.

#### Technology

- HTML & CSS.
- JavaScript (ES6).
- React.
- NodeJS & npm.
- The `create-react-app` template.

#### How to run

1. Download this repo.
2. Install NodeJS and npm.
3. On the terminal, `cd` to the repo.
4. Type `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
5. Type `npm start` to run. The app will show up under a local development server.

#### To-dos

- [x] Refactor code for the add-to-cart functionality.
- [x] Add ability to remove an item from cart.
- [x] Implement the search functionality.
- [x] Data validation for user's inputs.
- [ ] Calculation and displaying for total price.
- [ ] Styling with CSS.
- [ ] Implement the check-out functionality.

#### Observations

- We must be more careful when passing objects to a function. Since in JavaScript passing an object (or an array) to a function will pass the actual object (or array) itself. Hence, modifying that object inside the function results in mutating the object itself.
